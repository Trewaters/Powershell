SYNTAX
    Restart-Computer [[-ComputerName] <string[]>] [[-Credential] <PSCredential>] [-AsJob] [-Authentication {Default | N
    one | Connect | Call | Packet | PacketIntegrity | PacketPrivacy | Unchanged}] [-Force] [-Impersonation {Default | A

DESCRIPTION
    The Restart-Computer cmdlet restarts the operating system on the local and remote computers. 
    
    You can use the parameters of Restart-Computer to run the restart operations as a background job, to specify the au
    thentication levels and alternate credentials, to limit the operations that run concurrently, and to force an immed
    iate restart.
    
    This cmdlet does not require Windows PowerShell remoting unless you use the AsJob parameter.
    

PARAMETERS
    -AsJob [<SwitchParameter>]
        Runs the command as a background job.
        
        Note: To use this parameter, the local and remote computers must be configured for remoting and, on Windows Vis
        ta and later versions of Windows, you must open Windows PowerShell with the "Run as administrator" option. For 
        more information, see about_Remote_Requirements.
        
        When you use the AsJob parameter, the command immediately returns an object that represents the background job.
         You can continue to work in the session while the job completes. The job is created on the local computer and 
        the results from remote computers are automatically returned to the local computer. To manage the job, use the 
        Job cmdlets. To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.
        
        For more information about Windows PowerShell background jobs, see about_Jobs and about_Remote_Jobs.

    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>restart-computer
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command restarts the local computer.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>restart-computer -computername Server01, Server02, localhost
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command restarts two remote computers, Server01 and Server02, and the local computer, identified as "localhost
    ".
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>$j = restart-computer -computername Server01, Server02 -asjob 
    
    C:\PS> $results = $j | receive-job
    
    C:\PS> $results
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    These commands run a Restart-Computer command as a background job on two remote computers, and then get the results
    .
    
    The first command uses the AsJob parameter to run the command as a background job. The command saves the resulting 
    job object in the $j variable.
    
    The second command uses a pipeline operator to send the job object in $j to the Receive-Job cmdlet, which gets the 
    job results. The command saves the results in the $results variable. 
    
    The third command displays the result saved in the $results variable.
    
    Because the AsJob parameter creates the job on the local computer and automatically returns the results to the loca
    l computer, you can run the Receive-Job command as a local command.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>restart-computer -comp Server01 -impersonation anonymous -authentication PacketIntegrity
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command restarts the Server01 remote computer. The command uses customized impersonation and authentication se
    ttings.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>$s = get-content domain01.txt
    
    C:\PS> $c = get-credential domain01\admin01
    
    C:\PS> restart-computer -computername $s -force -throttlelimit 10 -credential $c
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    These commands force an immediate restart of all of the computers in Domain01. 
    
    The first command gets a list of computers in the domain and saves it in the $s variable.
    
    The second command gets the credentials of a domain administrator and saves them in the $c variable.
    
    The third command restarts the computers. It uses the ComputerName parameter to submit the list of computers in the
     $s variable, the Force parameter to force an immediate restart, and the Credential parameter to submit the credent
    ials saved in the $c variable. It also uses the ThrottleLimit parameter to limit the command to 10 concurrent conne
    ctions.
