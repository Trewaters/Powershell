NAME
    Invoke-History
    
SYNOPSIS
    Runs commands from the session history.
    
SYNTAX
    Invoke-History [[-Id] <string>] [-Confirm] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]
    
    
DESCRIPTION
    The Invoke-History cmdlet runs commands from the session history. You can pass objects representing the commands fr
    om Get-History to Invoke-History, or you can identify commands in the current history by using their ID number. To 
    find the identification number of a command, use Get-History.
    

PARAMETERS
    -Id <string>
        Identifies a command in the history. You can type the ID number of the command or the first few characters of t
        he command. 
        
        If you type characters, Invoke-History matches the most recent commands first. If you omit this parameter, Invo
        ke-History runs the last (most recent) command. The parameter name ("id") is optional. To find the ID number of
         a command, use Get-History.

NOTES
    
    
        The session history is a list of the commands entered during the session along with the ID. The session history
         represents the order of execution, the status, and the start and end times of the command. As you enter each c
        ommand, Windows PowerShell adds it to the history so that you can reuse it.  For more information about the ses
        sion history, see about_History.
        
        You can also refer to Invoke-History by its built-in aliases, "r" and "ihy". For more information, see about_Al
        iases.
        
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 1 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>invoke-history
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command runs the last (most recent) command in the session history. You can abbreviate this command as "r" (th
    ink "repeat" or "rerun"), the alias for Invoke-History.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 2 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>invoke-history -id 132
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command runs the command in the session history with ID 132. Because the name of the Id parameter is optional,
     you can abbreviate this command as "Invoke-History 132", "ihy 132", or "r 132".
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 3 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>invoke-history get-pr
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command runs the most recent Get-Process command in the session history. When you type characters for the Id p
    arameter, Invoke-History runs the first command that it finds that matches the pattern, beginning with the most rec
    ent commands. This command uses the ID parameter, but it omits the optional parameter name.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 4 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>invoke-history (16..24), 27
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command runs commands 16 through 24 and 27. You can list multiple IDs and ID ranges separated by commas.
    
    
    
    
    
    -------------------------- EXAMPLE 5 --------------------------
    
    C:\PS>get-history -id 255 -count 7 | invoke-history
    
    
    Description
    -----------
    This command runs the 7 commands in the history that end with command 255 (typically 249 through 255). It uses the 
    Get-History cmdlet to retrieve the commands. The pipeline operator (|) passes the commands to Invoke-History, which
     executes them.
